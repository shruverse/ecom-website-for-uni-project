# PHP Website Project

This project was created in my 2nd year as a part of my web development learning. Itâ€™s a fully functional website developed using **WAMPServer**, **Bootstrap**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **PHP**. The website includes both an **admin** and a **client** side, with features like **form validation** and a **payment gateway**.

## Features

- **Admin Side:**
  - Manage users and products.
  - View and track orders.
  - Generate reports.

- **Client Side:**
  - User registration and login with validation.
  - Browse products and add them to the cart.
  - Place orders and make payments.

- **Form Validation:**
  - Client-side and server-side validation for all forms.

- **Payment Gateway Integration:**
  - Users can securely make payments for their orders.

## Technologies Used

- **WAMPServer:** Local server environment for developing and testing.
- **PHP:** Backend scripting language to handle form submissions, session management, and database operations.
- **Bootstrap:** For responsive, mobile-first UI design.
- **HTML5/CSS3:** Markup and styling for building user interfaces.
- **MySQL:** Database to store user data, product info, and transactions.
